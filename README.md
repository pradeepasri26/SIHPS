## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
1.User Interface (UI):
Frontend application accessible via web browsers and mobile devices.
Provides the user interface for searching e-waste facilities, educational pop-ups, user account management, and rewards tracking.

2.Application Server:
Backend server responsible for handling user requests, processing data, and communicating with other components.
Implements the business logic of the application, including search functionality, rewards calculation, and user authentication.

3.Database:
Stores user data, e-waste facility information, device models, rewards points, and other relevant data.
Can be a relational database management system (RDBMS) or a NoSQL database depending on scalability and data structure requirements.

4.Geolocation Service:
Utilizes geolocation APIs to determine the user's location when they allow access or manually input it.
Provides location data to the application server for finding nearby e-waste facilities.

5.Educational Content Repository:
Repository for storing educational content related to e-waste recycling.
Contains information, images, videos, and interactive elements for displaying educational pop-ups and tooltips on the UI.

6.External APIs:
Integrates with external APIs for mapping and geolocation services to fetch and display e-waste facility locations on the map.
May also integrate with electronics manufacturers' APIs for retrieving device model information and calculating rewards points.

7.Partnership Integration:
Integrates with partner systems, such as electronics manufacturers or retailers, to provide exclusive incentives and rewards for users.
Communicates with partner APIs to validate rewards and incentives earned by users.
